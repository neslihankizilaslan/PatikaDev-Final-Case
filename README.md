All Final Case parts are inside doc folder as an Excel File but (just in case) if you want to reach file by link you can follow this;
[Final Case](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/186mQ9EFccBZyiMGvW6_xUfS26oQd_EXAxny0axVPPAM/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

If you want to check jira backlog items and jira tasks you can find them inside jira-backlog folder as screenshot images because jira doesn't allow public sharing. just in case I put the jira link;
[Jira](https://polatrojda96.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/RNTCAR/boards/1/timeline)

Also you can check mobile test cases (appium mobile) in tests folder
